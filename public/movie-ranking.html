<h1>My Favorite Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>Here is the Top 3 Movies</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>I am a fan of sci-fi movies. <br/>
This sci-fi movie reflects a truth about how our world really works.<br/>
A very mind bending concept of how our reality is<br/>
 a computer simulation controlled by Artificial intelligence. </p>

 <h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>A movie that tackle the concept of interstellar travel and the 
    idea of time dilation. A very mind bending film</p>

    <h3>Inception</h3>
<p>I love the idea of a person hijacking he dreams <br/>
    of other person ti plant a seeds of idea that can influence him in waking state.</p>
